                  Ice creams. They control us. they possess us. They clog our
                  arteries and make our thighs and tummies bulge. Yet we love
                  them, yet we eat them just for savouring a few moments of
                  ecstasy. We know that they do no good, but all worries are
                  forgotten when we lick the simply tantalizing and irresistible
                  cream. At that time, we are blissfully unaware of the horrible
                  consequences. THAT is the power of an ice cream.

                  I am not a big fan of sweets. But even then there are certain

                  We decided we wanted ice cream on a road trip Homemade ice
                  cream at its finest. They seem to use local ingredients and
                  turn them into some very unique flavours. My only regret is
                  that I couldn’t try them all.

                  What a better way to mourn the end of summer but with ice
                  cream. Something just drew us here and now I can't imagine ice
                  cream anywhere else. All the ice cream is home made and the
                  flavors are unique. Spicy mango! Yes! I had the adult coffee
                  strength and cherry vanilla chunk. Both were fresh and packed
                  with flavor. Prices are reasonable. Unfortunately she's
                  closing for the season today so we'll have to wait until next
                  year. Something to get us through the winter.

                  The best ice cream (I've tried 4 flavors plus a malted shake)
                  I've ever had. and the hot fudge sauce is amazing. You can
                  also purchase hand-packed containers of the home made ice
                  cream and fudge sauce to take home.

                  My wife and grandson love good ice cream and are fussy about
                  what's good. So, we never stopped before this summer. They
                  didn't have a huge selection, but they had several that we
                  liked. So, we went back several times before they closed for
                  the winter. Can't wait til they open again.
